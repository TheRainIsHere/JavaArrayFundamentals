## Overview

|             | _col 1_ | _col 2_ | _col 3_ |
| ----------- |---------|---------|---------|
| _**row 1**_ |   r1c1  |   r1c2  |   r1c3  |
| _**row 2**_ |   r2c1  |   r2c2  |   r2c3  |
| _**row 3**_ |   r3c1  |   r3c2  |   r3c3  |

Two-dimensional arrays (2D arrays) are a data structure that can be used to store data in a tabular format. Each element in a 2D array is associated with a row and a column number. This makes 2D arrays ideal for storing data that is naturally organized in rows and columns, such as spreadsheets, matrices, images, and game boards. Working with 2D arrays in Java is relatively straightforward. The int[][] data type is used to declare a 2D array. The first dimension of the array represents the number of rows, and the second dimension represents the number of columns. Each element in the array can be accessed using its row and column numbers. 2D arrays are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in Java programming. They are especially useful for applications that involve data tables, image processing, and game development. Here are some specific examples of how 2D arrays are used in Java programming:

Data tables: 2D arrays can be used to store data in a tabular format, such as a spreadsheet or a database table. This makes them ideal for applications that need to store and manipulate large amounts of data.

Image processing: 2D arrays can be used to store the pixels of an image. This allows Java programs to manipulate images by accessing and modifying individual pixels.

Game development: 2D arrays can be used to store the game board, the player's position, and the position of enemies and other objects in the game. This allows Java games to be rendered and updated efficiently.

## Instructions

### Open the Project
1. From the **<> Code** dropdown link in the repository (above), download the Zip file to your computer.
2. Extract the files to your working folder
3. Open Eclipse and import the project. 
   - You can use File>Import menu item or right-click in the Package Manager and choose Import.
   - select General>Projects from Folder or Archive
   - navigate into the project until you see the `bin` and `src` folders, and choose *open*
4. Expand the project in the package explorer and find the .java files below the **src** folder.

### Complete the Assignment
1. Run the **Test** file (`M2TestArrayChallenge.java`) and add the code to the source file
(`M2ArrayChallenge.java`) until the tests are successful.
3. Uncomment each test case in the test file, one at a time. Do not modify the content 
in this file except to uncomment the tests. Modify the code (in `M2ArrayChallenge.java`) as 
needed for the tests to pass.
4. Review and refactor any of the code (`M2ArrayChallenge.java`) as needed:
    - be sure your code follows good coding practices and coding style and standards.
    - update the javadoc comments at the top of the file to add your name as author
    - update the comments for each method in the file.
5. Export the project as a zip file and submit your work.
