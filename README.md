## Overview

Java arrays are a fundamental data structure that store multiple elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays in Java are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is accessed at index 0. They are fixed in size, so the number of elements is defined when the array is created and cannot be changed. Arrays can hold primitive types like int, char, and double, or objects like String and custom classes. To work with arrays, Java provides various methods and loops to iterate, manipulate, and access elements efficiently.

## Instructions

### Open the Project
1. From the **<> Code** dropdown link in the repository (above), download the Zip file to your computer.
2. Extract the files to your working folder
3. Open Eclipse and import the project. 
   - You can use File>Import menu item or right-click in the Package Manager and choose Import.
   - select General>Projects from Folder or Archive
   - navigate into the project until you see the `bin` and `src` folders, and choose *open*
4. Expand the project in the package explorer and find the .java files below the **src** folder.

### Complete the Assignment
1. Run the **Test** file (`M2TestArrayChallenge.java`) and add the code to the source file
(`M2ArrayChallenge.java`) until the tests are successful.
3. Uncomment each test case in the test file, one at a time. Do not modify the content 
in this file except to uncomment the tests. Modify the code (in `M2ArrayChallenge.java`) as 
needed for the tests to pass.
4. Review and refactor any of the code (`M2ArrayChallenge.java`) as needed:
    - be sure your code follows good coding practices and coding style and standards.
    - update the javadoc comments at the top of the file to add your name as author
    - update the comments for each method in the file.
5. Export the project as a zip file and submit your work.

_this repository is a subset of the CISC191 exercises. It is derived from the CISC191ProgrammingChallenges 
activity hosted by Professor Allan Schougaard, San Diego Mesa College, and not a direct fork._

_This is an effort to decompose that repository into git submodules_
